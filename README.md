## Summary
The idea of food spoilage in Foundry VTT has been inquired about before; macros and other such exist as proof-of-concepts for interested GMs, and there may be a system or two with mechanics around it.

Expiry is a module that seeks to give GMs unlimited flexibility in creating food that automatically spoils and changes state within the player's inventory. A spoiled apple can rot away entirely or become a different consumable, one with the chance to poison an unlucky player.

Expiry makes use of the community-standard Simple Calendar module to track time in-game.
